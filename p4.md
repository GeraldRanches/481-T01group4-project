# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary
Cooking Papa is a cooking instructor app with a parent-specific user base, intending to assist distracted users within their homes as they cook for their families for occasions such as birthday parties or family dinners. User research mainly based on IDEO methods and usability testing informed our team that continuous distraction from their families, multitasking, the memorization of ingredient names and ingredient measurements, and hardcopy maintenance of recipe lists were common issues amongst our targeted user base. Currently a hifi-prototype, Cooking Papa’s features include the display, creation, search, and favoriting of recipes, all of which had certain aspects that alleviated those aforementioned problems. 
Recipes are viewed in a step-by-step format, with each step taking an entire screen, which was done in order to keep the user focused on the particular step despite distraction. Rather than just a textual instruction, we decided to include an image or gif of the step to aid in the completion of the step. We also agreed that including the ingredient list specific to a particular step would accommodate for the parent’s need to recall an ingredient’s measurement amongst distraction. The added audio feature of the instruction would assist in the case that they are doing multiple activities at once. They recipe as a whole is summarized by a simple ingredient list in the main screen of the desired recipe, and a user can simply add the recipe to their favorites if they want to look at it again. The measurements of the ingredients are increased or decreased based on the serving size indicated by the user. Furthermore, there is a ‘Continue’ option in the case that the recipe has been previously accessed by the user, allowing them to return to their most recently accessed step if they did not yet complete it. The creation feature has the same template as a regular recipe display, with text boxes replacing the text and the ability to include a gif or image or audio as an option. This would promote positive transfer from the recipe page that we have for their perusal. The search function, accessible from the front menu, dynamically populates based on the desired input, which aids in the case they are unsure as to what they want to locate. 
However, despite these features, errors stemmed from the very basis of the design. We realized that we were missing several features that made the app usable and polished. Although claimed as a hifi-prototype, its messy appearance and half-finished functionality crippled its quality. Major issues such as poorly planned recipe access and incomplete recipe creation representation rendered the app inefficient and questionable, and the skeuomorphism lead to unacceptable visual design within the interface.
In future iterations, we will be going back to the investigation portion of user centered system design to flesh out the problems our user base has in terms of the issue we mentioned earlier on. The book design will be completely removed in exchange for a more modern appearance - list view preferable. We will incorporate design ideas such as landscape and portrait views, filtering for our searches or profiles depending on the people that the user would like to cook for, and easier methods to access recipes. We eagerly seek to improve on both the appearance of Cooking Papa and its functionalities for our users’ use and stakeholders’ benefits.
## Introduction

Parents - our target consumer base - normally have multiple tasks they have to complete at once, alongside a variety of distractions they must handle in order to ensure a working household. Amongst their many tasks, we decided to focus on aiding the household chore of cooking. In short, our project, called Cooking Papa, revolves around a cooking instructor system - or cooking aid system - that allows them to successfully maintain their recipes in a single space to minimize clutter on their counters while keeping track of their progress in their desired recipe despite the numerous inevitable distractions in their own homes. 

## Design Problem

As explained in the introduction, our customer base centers about multitasking parents. The design problem we tackled was “How should we design technology that can aid distracted parents as they cook for multiple people?”

## User Research and Findings

One of the user research methods that utilized was Fly on the Wall. This was executed in one of our teammate’s homes, whereby their presence was largely ignored by the subject (her mother) we intended to examine. The purpose of using this method was to examine our target user in their natural habitat: through this, we see little quirks that would be otherwise unnoticed had we direct contact with them. 
Findings:

-       The subject made multiple recipes at the same time.
-       The subject muttered ingredient measurements repeatedly under her breath as she went to the particular recipe that needed that ingredient.
-       The subject went back and forth between her notebook, which seemed to hold her recipes. 
-       The notebook was placed far away from her place of cooking: it seemed that she didn’t want to clutter her workspace. 
-       Her environment was rather chaotic, surrounded by curious family members and loud media, such as television programs and computer games, playing in the background. 
-       The subject regularly left the kitchen when she had to wait for her food to cook.
-       The subject was not always the only one in the kitchen.
-       The kitchen was not near a window; she had to turn on the lights in order to see her book.

Another user research method that we used was Extreme User Interview. This was executed by enlisting one of our teammate’s contacts, Matthew Chui, who commonly creates gourmet dishes for his own purposes. He is considered “extreme” due to his primary focus on dishes that are viewed as difficult to create and that he follows recipes to the dot. Our priority when we decided on Extreme User Interviews was to gain information that an ‘average’ user would not be able to provide or notice, and to give an outlook on what our limits would be in terms of information representation and visualization for the typical user.
Findings:

- Matthew normally creates dishes that are viewed as strange or ‘different’ by those who witness them.
- He is software savvy.
- Matthew never improvises dishes because he prefers their original taste.
- He learns new recipes through his mother or through google searches.
- If Matthew does not have the ingredients of the recipe that he’s looking at, he will save the recipe and make it later once he does have all the ingredients.
- He maintains his recipes on his computer, but he only refers to the printed copy of those recipes.
- He prefers paper copies of the recipe because he doesn’t want to harm any electronic devices (eg. phone) in the process of his cooking.

Our third research method we attempted was Try It For Yourself. For this method, we had one of our teammates act as if they were a regular user cooking a recipe they had never made before. In his case, he made sushi based on the instructions on the back of seaweed packaging that he had in his home. Our intention for this method was to simulate a possible user’s emotions and actions as they followed the instructions of a new recipe. Through this, we would gain insight on a user’s task flow as they did so.
Findings:

- He found that recipes could be retrieved from an ingredient’s container.
- Adrian noted that the text of the instruction was hard to follow.
- When he googled a video of the instructions instead, it was easier to understand what the text actually meant.
- “Toppings as you desire” was a line that he read in the instructions, which prompted him to look for ingredients that he could possibly have.
- He only went ahead and made the recipe because he had the ingredients that the recipe listed.
- Adrian first looked at the recipe as a whole, and just looked at each individual step when he needed to.

It was during the evaluation period that we revisited further research methods in order to adjust our ideas for our prototype.
	
Early in the design process a storyboard was created to depict the completion of a task identified from the design problem. The task involved navigating through the interface and the use of key functionality such as searching, bookmarking, and favoriting. Through an early version of our system, we depicted a walkthrough of each step that was needed to complete the task. The process of creating the storyboard allowed us to evaluate the system that we had at the time.
Findings:
-       User entered input is needed for certain functionality of the system. This includes the search system, and the adjustment of the serving sizes.
-       The method to receive user input was unclear as we were unsure on what platform the system would be handled on.
-       The back button is useful when the user wants to navigate between the search results and different recipes.
-       The bookmarks feature and the resuming of a session from the main menu were similar in terms of functionality, so the ‘resume’ functionality was removed.

We composed a Video Prototype for that reason. However, we first had to create a paper prototype by utilizing cardboard and strings to mimic the actual system with the various features we wanted to add on to our interface. We used a previously created storyboard as the task we were to test. Through this, we’ll get a rough approximation of the feel of the system based on the actions we wanted to take.
Findings:
- The icons we chose were ambiguous, specifically the back button.
- The favorites and bookmarking system we had implemented felt redundant.
- It is not intuitive to notice that one can have multiple bookmarks.
- It was difficult to distinguish what each category entailed.
	
Another evaluation-stage user research method that we completed was Contextual Interview. One of our teammates had his father, mother, and sister use our hi-fi prototype, going back and forth between the Think-Aloud method and Conceptual Model Extraction method after he provided them several tasks, such as creating the recipe and searching for the recipe they created. In this method, we sought their first impressions of our prototype and their task flow as they handled our prototype.
Findings:
- The interviewees misunderstood the application of the bookmarks, both the adding of the bookmark and the utilization of the bookmark.
- His mother thought that the bookmark was a zoom feature.
- They all thought the numbers on the bookmarks meant it was the step number.
- For creation of the recipe, all of them skipped several of the input fields that we first thought imperative to creating the recipe.
- Also in the creation of the recipe, his mother misspelled the recipe she was creating.
- Order of buttons matters, with the father going from top to bottom on the menu in order to create the recipe.
- Some users, notably the father, did not know how to leave the keyboard controls of the phone.
- All of the subjects did not realize that we were attempting a book mimicry.

## Design and Justification

As a group, we determined design choices for our cooking application that would benefit distracted, multitasking parents.

The most notable of all our design decisions that we made was our choice to have the application resemble a book. In hopes of positive transfer, based on the conclusion drawn from our user research that paper copies were most relied upon for recipe management, we chose to have it resemble a book shape-wise and font-wise. We wanted the user to attempt to swipe through the pages, which was a feature that we included when perusing the various lists in our interface.

Another major design decision of ours was that we chose to display steps individually rather than altogether. We considered how parents are distracted by their environment and that they focused on the ingredients that they needed for a particular step rather than all of the ingredients at once. We accommodated for that need by separating each step of the recipe for the parents to utilize. The ingredients provided in those steps are limited by the ingredients required in that specific step to eliminate skimming through a set of ingredients and increase efficiency.

Related to the previously mentioned feature, we added the possibility of having gifs or images per instruction set. From our user research, we came to the realization that text can be ambiguous, especially since terminology vary between cookbooks or recipes. We also concluded from the research that having an animation or finished image was useful supplementary information besides the text instruction, hence why this feature came to light.

Due to the fact that parents typically cook for more people than themselves, we added the feature of adjustable serving sizes. Defaulted to one serving, we allow our users to manipulate that number into their desired (integer restricted) serving size and adjust the ingredient measurements based on that serving size.

Attempting to communicate a menu layout, we used categories to access recipes based on a common attribute. Though admittedly limited by population stereotype and cultural idioms - in our case, the western sort - it was a categorical method of searching for recipes if they did not know exactly what recipe they wanted to make but had a key phrase in mind.

Contrasting to the design choice we discussed above, we also added a search bar for recipes that yielded a dynamically populating list of recipes. This was in the case that the user had absolutely no idea what they were searching for. We considered that many people searched up generic inputs such as ‘Easy recipes’, thus we had ‘Enter a recipe name’ inside of the search bar to prevent confusion.

A small, but important design choice that we added were icons that would go back to the home screen as well as a back button that did a ‘reverse choice’ function. These were provided to maintain external consistency with other applications that had home buttons and back buttons. The back button remains ambiguous, unfortunately.

This is not so much an implementation, but a compensation for a feature. Following the book theme, we were enamoured by the idea of having bookmarks to keep a recent ‘session’ of the user, in the case that they wanted to return to a desired step in a particular recipe. We also wanted to attempt at a multiple-recipe-session. However, the size of our bookmark feature was too small to actually indicate any relevant information of what they bookmarked, and usability testing informed us that - in fact - no one knew how the feature worked. 
Because of this, we came to a compromise and added a ‘Continue’ function per recipe. If they accessed the recipe, it was marked as ‘in progress’ until they finished it. A button that stated ‘Continue’ would show up on the relevant, in progress recipe and accessing it would let the user jump to their most recent step within that recipe.

Filtering recipes based on the preferences, dietary constraints, or allergies of who the user was planning to cook for was a feature that we thought was one of the most important feature that we were not able to include. Its exclusion stemmed from a mixture of awkward time management and a focus on the other features that we viewed as more important at that time.


## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

Due to our rushed handling of the project, we found many minor and easily fixable errors. For example, there were issues with semantics concerning buttons that would lead to confusion to the user. 
	
(1) One of the main issues, which violated the Match Between System and Real World heuristic, that we zoned in on concerned the access of recipes at various points in our app, such as in My Creations, Favorites, while going through the steps of a recipe, and within all of the subheaders beneath the Categories header. In each of these, the user is able to flip between the pages, but is unable to select a page outside of the previous and following page. Thus, the consensus between the team was that we wanted either to have a drop down list of pages (specifically for the recipe steps) or a list of page numbers similar to many archives on the web (ex. Google) for each screen.

(2) Another violation we came across violated the error prevention heuristic. Simply speaking, we never managed to add a method to add an ingredient separate from its measurement. This would severely hinder another function of ours (the ability to increase serving sizes and multiplying the amount of ingredients for the user), so a fix we proposed was to create two text boxes (measurement and ingredient name respectively) and a drop down menu (for the measurement type).

(3) Because we created the drop down list for the recipe step list very last minute, we realized soon in our heuristic evaluations that the steps listed in them contained no useful information for the user. This violated the Flexibility and Efficiency of Use heuristic. In creation, it would hinder the user because they would not know whether or not they already created a step. While editing the steps, there is no way for them to know what step they need to fix aside from memorizing the steps by the number it is assigned. Therefore, we suggested that we have a short summary - the first two words of the instructions - or have an image of the step because images are easier to recall over text. A final fix that popped up was to simply have a table of contents for those steps.

(4) The fourth issue, which violated the Flexibility and Efficiency of Use heuristic, we located was specifically the state of a user’s composed recipe when they opened it. All the recipes a user created was only accessible in an ‘Edit’ state, which would compromise the user’s perception of how they would utilize the recipe. Also, there was a chance of error on the user’s part with the continuous exposure of editable text boxes as they iterated through their recipe. The fix we considered was creating icons within the button itself, such as a pencil meaning edit, an eye to look, and a trash can icon to delete it. This would deal with several aspects of handling a user’s created recipe.

(5) Our last main issue that we thought imperative for repair was related to Flexibility and Efficiency of Use heuristic was the lack of ability to look at the recipe as a whole. Most people are used to accessing recipes either via paper or online sources, and those sources represent recipes in a list format. The split-step design significantly slows down users and breaks the way that they access those recipes. We would remedy this by having an alternative list view of the recipe steps available to those who want to access it.

(6) Although not in our heuristic evaluation, we came to the conclusion that the book-style skeuomorphism was significantly detrimental in translating the functions of the app to the user. It made it difficult to see the zoom function that the instructions had, which allowed users to tap the text instructions to make it larger. It also caused confusion for the category headers, which caused their perceived affordance of the text buttons to be that of just text.

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design
In our next iteration, we have a large list of things we would like to change.

- To deal with our sixth main heuristic evaluation violation we would remove skeumorphism (book layout) and maybe make the design portrait instead of landscape so it won’t be so compressed on phones
-       Dedicate more time to filtering recipes with users’ dietary constraints
-       To deal with our first main heuristic evaluation violation, we would like to have a page number on steps and create recipes to get to steps faster, have a page number on the list of recipes in the categories and the search results to navigate through the pages quicker.
-       On ingredients list, have 2 columns, one for quantity and 1 for name, and the quantity updates by serving size the user enters
-       Have buttons, text, and layout more consistent, definitely look into CRAP more when coming up with our design
-       Look into making the create recipe interface easier to use and navigate
-       Have short temporary error or notification prompts to when user does certain things to let the user know things like, progress of a recipe has been saved or completed
-       To continue a recipe, user would have to find it, add a section in the front page called “my progress” to find them faster
-       Grey out sections and categories that are empty so the user can’t select it, and will get stuck until they find the back button on the left, or have that empty category say something like “this category is empty, return to home”
-   	Have a way for user to remove steps on their created recipes without having to find the specific step


## Conclusions

Through the completion of this project, we learned first-hand the problems of skeuomorphism without meaning, and that one iteration of brainstorming was not sufficient. We would have alleviated many of our problems had we included even more user research than we already did; alongside that, we should keep our mind open in how to triangulate IDEO methods to form a better and cohesive model of what our users and stakeholders would want within a cooking instructor application.
