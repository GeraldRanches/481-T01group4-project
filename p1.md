# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

Our project, (name forthcoming), is essentially a simple cookbook phone app. The intended use is for its users to store their own recipes, alongside alternative ingredients that they have chosen to use either because of preference or due to resource constraint. It is primarily intended for parents who require concurrent access to multiple recipes despite the distractions (which constitutes of their family or chores) that surround them. The app’s capabilities also constitute the ability to resume from the most recent recipe, and that recipe’s most recently accessed step, especially if their child gains access to their phone in order to play games on it. Also, it allows users to add alternative ingredients to the recipe in the case where they (or their family) have different preferences to how the recipe should be created, and it can be saved for future use.

## Stakeholders and Users

People who cook (more specifically, parents cooking for families)
The design of the system focuses on having the cooking process as simple and easy as possible, hence why the main idea is for the user to stock their recipes in one, easily accessible place. Parents are also frequently distracted by the ongoings of their house, such as children or chores, which led to the “resume” and “bookmark” features, which let the users return to their last step, or the last recipe that they intended to cook. 

People who eat the food (children, guests, etc)
Those who eat the food have preferences/restrictions in their diet, which is why we allotted the design to filter foods that follow said preferences/restrictions. There is also recipes that they find more preferable, which is covered by the “add recipe to favourite” feature.
	
Recipe creators
Because this app also functions as a database of recipes that people can access, it allows those with their own recipes to add recipes for others to utilize. 

Dieticians
Can recommend app to those who would like to keep track of what foods they can have and their preferences/restrictions.


## User Research Methods

### User Research Method 1: Fly on the Wall


Our app is centered around the issues of parents cooking at home, alongside their need to keep track of their recipes. By observing someone cooking in action, we would know where exactly they would put their phone, how distracted they truly get by their surroundings, and how often they would refer back to their recipe books.

In this case, we had Farrah observe her mom cooking dinner at home, where she noted that her mother made several meals at once, one being dessert and the other a meal. In terms of distraction, her dad had the TV blaring loudly in the background while the rest of her siblings would talk and wander into the kitchen to either grab random snacks or ask when the food was done. Whenever she would go from one recipe to another, she would refer back to a small black notebook that is presumably where she keeps her recipes. She would do multiple steps at once with the recipe, looking at the recipe if necessary. Beneath her breath, she would mutter measurements. Her mom also would leave the kitchen while she was waiting for food to finish and watch TV with her dad. 

Through this, we took note that distractions are frequent and continuous, and meals are not made singularly, but concurrently. Furthermore, we noted that the entire recipe is not always needed.

Reflection
By observing her mother without indication of doing so, we were able to glean important information such as natural habits and the regular flow of her activity, as well as what of the environment normally affected her activity. However, we were not able to confirm exactly why she was doing such things, such as what exactly she was looking for in her notebook. We did not know the exact issues going through her mind as she was cooking. For the most part, the observation went well – though, unfortunately, there were times when Farrah would get too close and stumble into her mom while looking for food. She inevitably ended up being one of her mother’s distractions due to being a part of the environment. Perhaps someone that was less close (relationship-wise) would be better to observe?


### User Research Method 2: Interview

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/cookbook1.jpg "Chinese cookbook")


Interview (a)
For one of our research methods, we conducted our research through interviews. Interviewing people worked well with our project topic since it allowed us to ask them questions that could be important to our system, and get feedback on what they think. 
From the interviews, we learned that people have their own methods of keeping and using recipes that works for them because they are comfortable with it. One of the interviewees had cookbooks that held most of her recipes, and another solely went off memory (and a little bit of skill?). The interviewees also had different ways of learning and finding new recipes: one would watch videos while taking notes and cook using those notes; while the other would recall something on a show he’d seen and try to replicate it from memory.
Reflection
During the interviews, clarification on what we meant with some of the questions had to be made, and the flow of the questions felt off. Having clearer questions and reordering the questions would have made the interviews go smoothly.

Interview (b) – Adrian POV
Matthew Chui is a first-year student with a fair amount of cooking experience gained from his mother. He is very software savvy as he uses the internet to find new recipes, keeping track of all of them on his computer. Matt often cooks for himself because most of his dishes are first time creations and his parents find the recipes chosen to be “weird” or “requires expensive ingredients”. He also checks if he has 100% of the ingredients before starting the dish, leaving no room for improvisation. He claims he wants to know what the dish originally tastes like without altering the recipe.

The interview with Matt provided some significant points to our project. We discovered that although he is software savvy, he still prefers to print out the recipe and follow them off paper. Since our application requires a phone or tablet, he claims that he would not risk endangering his phone in the kitchen. Although Matt doesn’t improvise because he wants the original taste of the dish, he says it may be helpful to have suggested alternatives if it reduces the cost of the dish.

The following questions were asked, along with their answer
-	What kind of experience do you have with cooking?
	Quite a bit of experience, often makes gourmet meals

-	Where did you gain this experience?
	From my mother

-	Where do you learn new recipes?
	I find recipes on the internet

-	How do you keep track of the recipes you learn?
	On my computer

-	Would you say that you are software savvy?
	Yes

-	Since it’s on the computer, is there a computer or laptop near your kitchen?
	No, I print out the recipes

-	What if you had the recipes on your phone, would you find it more convenient to follow the recipes off that?
	It would be the same as following it on paper, minus the risk of dropping my phone or spilling liquid on it

-	With the recipes you follow, what do you do if you find that you are lacking on ingredients?
	I don’t cook the dish, I normally check to make sure I have everything before I start

-	What if you started a dish, and then realize that you are missing an ingredient?
	I would probably reduce the portion

-	Would you ever attempt to improvise on a recipe? Or substitute for a missing ingredient?
	Nah, not really

-	Why is that?
	I want to know what the recipe tastes like without modification

-	With these recipes, who do you normally cook for?
	Myself only

-	What about friends or family?
	My family says the dishes I make are weird. Or refuse to eat it because it was expensive to make

Reflection
The questions I asked may have been straightforward because Matt is a friend of mine who I previously known has cooking experience and is very tech savvy. Although one would suspect that an interviewee is more likely to answer questions to satisfy the interviewer, Matt provided excellent responses with to the questions, as his responses had me think twice about our approach with our project. Perhaps he is correct, there are people that prefer recipes on paper than on phone. A better approach one may suggest for improving research method would be to interview people at random instead of people we know, and have a collection of responses from people; it may be the case that Matt is one of many people that prefers paper to phone. Furthermore, having multiple interviewees would provide us with a variety of concerns regarding our approach to our project.


### User Research Method 3: Try it yourself

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/tryityourself.jpg "Farrahs observations")

Try It Yourself – Adrian POV
To simulate a more real-life scenario, I decided to pick a recipe that contained a main ingredient that I was sure I had, without checking all other ingredients. The recipe chosen was creamy mashed potatoes found at https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/easy-homemade-mashed-potatoes/09f0bba4-8bb9-4ce3-8d98-ae7a803eb7d5. As I followed the steps to the bone, I discovered that milk is required to make the dish creamy, however I “forgot” to do groceries and therefore had no milk. So, I wondered to myself, “what can I do to make these mashed potatoes creamy?” I searched the pantry, cupboards and fridge for some sort of alternative: almond milk, coffee cream, or even condensed milk. The alternative I found was cream of mushroom soup and thought, “this could either turn out really good, or really bad.” The dish turned out better than most mashed potatoes I’ve tasted. It had a creamy texture with bits of mushroom pieces hidden in the dish. The recipe I tried to follow step by step may have resulted in a generic dish, however if there was a way I can add in alternatives in the form of suggestions or comments for other people to try out, I figure that will open many doors for recipe improvisation for other users.

Reflection
This research method was an attempt to understand the how a user follows instructions and what they would do if they encounter a problem in the middle of the recipe. Choosing a recipe where the main ingredient is in their inventory was to ensure that I’m still making the desired dish; what is mashed potatoes without potatoes, for example. The problem with this method was that I have cooking experience, especially with improvising on the fly. So, the problem where I lacked milk may not be as easy to overcome for other users. Instead of using this method, maybe having someone try what I did, as I observe. I would instruct the guinea pig to make mashed potatoes and if he/she encounters the issue I face, I would then instruct him/her to improvise on the recipe. This would allow me to see what a typical user would do or how they are feeling in this situation.

## Task Descriptions

1.
Khadija Abdulla is a 31-year-old woman who has four kids of ages 4, 6, 10, and 13. Because her husband left her when the fourth child was born, she is very occupied with both a day job and a night job, one being part time. 

She normally writes her recipes in a journal, but frequently finds that her youngest child draws on it. Also, her children use her phone to play games and there are times that she won’t know where her phone is. The oldest child has a habit of raiding the pantry for ingredients, and it is not unusual for Khadija to end up missing ingredients when she’s cooking.

Due to her labor-intensive work, the meals she makes are repetitive and her children are beginning to complain. Khadija’s desire is to learn a new recipe that can be made in large batches (in a short amount of time) that will appeal to her children and end the complaints. Furthermore, they are of the Muslim religion, so they require the recipes be in halal.

She has recently downloaded this app due to the prompting of her work friends, but has trouble using software.

2.
Shawn Thomas is a 23-year-old father of one 8-year-old boy. Because his wife regularly sets her food on fire (and not on purpose), he is often found on chef duty. However, he is by no means a master chef, and prides himself in making simple, but delicious meals. Him and his wife both have decently-paying jobs, so they never find themselves without ingredients. Every week, his son likes to have play dates where he brings at least four of his friends to their home. Shawn wants to show off to the parents of those friends by making a new set of snacks when the kids come over. He has been using this app, primarily to keep his own recipes, but wants to simply get a new recipe instead.

3.
Marky Mark Wahlberg is a single bachelor with a hot bod who likes to work out and eat healthy. Due to his busy schedule, he decides to cook his meals for the week before hand. From the various fitness magazines, he reads he knows what he wants to cook, and how many meals he wants to prepare, but doesn’t know how to cook them in the portions that he wants. For each meal, he finds and cooks them based off recipes he finds modified to the portions he wants. This weekend, he wants something low-calorie that he can easily modify for a larger portion of protein. 

4.
Hideki Ryuga is a genius detective who loves to eat nothing but sweets. However, he knows that he cannot live solely on the sweets he buys at the store, so he decides he’ll need to start making some sweets that contain some nutrients. Being a genius, he just needs to see what ingredients he needs and knows that he can figure out how to cook his sweets by just the ingredients. He knows how anything works, and knows very well how to use software.

5.
Shimakaze is an experienced cook, and often does not need to look at cooking instructions for her meals. One day, she decides to surprise Adrian (the person she admires) by cooking for him. She discovers that his favorite food is samosas, a dish completely new to her. She searches for the recipe and discovers that the best top samosa recipes have meat in them, but Adrian doesn’t eat meat at all. Shimakaze wants to improvise on a popular recipe and make a dish that will appeal to Adrian’s liking and diet.

6.
Amatsukaze is an exchange student from Japan currently studying in Calgary. One day she discovers that today is Adrian-onii-chan’s birthday and wants to bake him a cake before he gets home from school. Adrian is her homestay older brother. Her homestay mother lends her a cookbook and shows Amatsukaze where all the equipment and ingredients are before she goes to work. She begins to read the instructions and since English is not her first language, she has difficulty reading the text. Amatsukaze wants to be able to cook a recipe that is easy to follow and understand.
