## Highlight Walkthrough

### Functionality Highlight #1: Finding recipes

If the user doesn’t know what they want to cook, they can look through the different categories to find something to cook. When in a category, the user can see pages listing all the recipes that are already in the system. On the other hand, if the user knows the recipe that they want to cook, they can quickly find it through the searching feature by typing in the recipe name.

### Functionality Highlight #2: Learning how to cook
![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/p3-recipetitle.png "The title page of a recipe")

When the user has found a that they want to cook they are brought to the recipe title screen. The list of all the ingredients needed for the recipe are shown here so that the user can immediately know whether they can cook it with the ingredients they have or they need to find a new recipe. Here they can see a picture of the recipe’s finished product, adjust the serving size of the recipe, favourite the recipe for use later, and start the recipe.

 Once started, the user goes through the steps to complete the recipe, and can navigate through the steps using the arrows at the bottom left and right of the screen. The user is told the ingredients for the specific step, has access to a picture performing the step, and access to a larger picture if the picture is pressed. The user is also given two ways to receive the instructions of the step; if the speaker is pressed, an audio clip of the instructions is played, and the user can read the instructions, where if pressed, show a zoomed in version of the instructions. When finished, the user is brought back to the recipe title screen and given another chance to favourite the recipe.

### Functionality Highlight #3: Creating recipes

If a user wants to create a recipe and save it to they system, they can press the “My Creations” button in the home screen, where they will be brought to a screen containing any recipes they have created in the past. The user can create a recipe by pressing on the “+ Create Recipe” button, where they will then be brought to a create recipe title screen.

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/p3-createtitle.png "Main page when creating a recipe")

From the recipe title screen, the user can set the name of the recipe, add any pictures to the title screen, add ingredients, go to a specific step, add steps to the recipe, save the recipe when they are done, and discard the recipe if they no longer want to keep it.

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/p3-createstep.png "Creating a recipe step")

When the user adds steps, they are brought to a step creation recipe. Here they can add pictures, ingredients for the steps, instructions for the steps, and can either discard the step or save the step to the recipe.

| Match between system and the real world | When a category has many recipes, the user may be irrated at having to find a recipe among many pages of recipes         | Have page numbers that the user can jump to, similar to google, or a drop down list of page numbers the user can select to jump to |
| Error Prevention                        | Adding ingredient doesn't make space for separating the measurement and the ingredient                                   | Make two text boxes for the amount of ingredient and the ingredient name, one drop down for the measurement type                   |
| Recognition rather than Recall          | Don't know what a step actually contains in the create recipe portion, may cause repeats                                 | Have a summary of the step; or have the first few words of the instructions within the drop down                                   |

| Flexibility and efficiency of use       | No way to quickly look through a recipes instructions, need to keep pressing next page to see all instructions.          | Have a quick view of all the instruction steps.                                                                                    |
