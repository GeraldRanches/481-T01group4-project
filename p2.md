## Task-Centered System Walkthrough
## Task Description: 
Khadija Abdulla is a 31-year-old woman who has four kids of ages 4, 6, 10, and 13. Because her husband left her when the fourth child was born, she is very occupied with both a day job and a night job, one being part time.

She normally writes her recipes in a journal, but frequently finds that her youngest child draws on it. Also, her children use her phone to play games and there are times that she won’t know where her phone is. The oldest child has a habit of raiding the pantry for ingredients, and it is not unusual for Khadija to end up missing ingredients when she’s cooking.

Due to her labor-intensive work, the meals she makes are repetitive and her children are beginning to complain. Khadija’s desire is to learn a new recipe that can be made in large batches (in a short amount of time) that will appeal to her children and end the complaints. Furthermore, they are of the Muslim religion, so they require the recipes be in halal.

She has recently downloaded this app due to the prompting of her work friends, but has trouble using software.

Sub-Task | Knowledgeable? Believable? Has motivation? | Comment/Solution |
--- | --- | --- |
1) Opens app |Khadija knows how to use a phone, it is believable that she would open it, and she would have the motivation to open the app in order to access it. | Should probably figure out a noticeable icon
2)	Selects the ‘Halal’ filtering on the front | Knowledge-wise, she is aware of the phrase and would choose it.<br><br>It would be believable that she would choose it do so, given the fact that, due to Khadija’s background, she would check whether or not her food is halal before eating it. <br><br>She would have the motivation to do so because she wants her food to be halal.|The wording and placement of the ‘halal’ filter will disappear if she decides to choose anything onward (ie. A category or recipe), which may cause some confusion for Khadija because she may think that the filter has disappeared.<br><br> Should research what ‘halal’ means. Should we instead let them filter ‘pork’ out? Or would it be more accommodating to write down ‘halal’?<br><br>Solution a?: Allow them more freedom with filtering.<br><br>Solution b: Allow them filter on the actual search bar instead?<br><br>Solution c: Change how it looks like by designating a special area in the main menu specifically for filters.
3)	Searches up a meal using the search bar | Because she likely has experience with search bars on the internet, she would have the knowledge to use it.<br><br>It may not be believable because she may, instead, choose a category to filter her options.<br><br>She would not have the motivation to use the search bar because she wouldn’t know what to search up in the first place. | When people are looking for new recipes, they normally search general terminology, ie. “Good and easy recipes” and look through the list to see which looks best. They don’t look up a particular recipe if they don’t know what they’re looking for.<br><br>Solution: Add “popular” or “recommended” meals so she doesn’t have to manually search things. Sort the meals by popularity as well.
4)	Chooses a meal from the results in the search bar | She knows how to select items from a list.<br><br>It is believable that she would choose at least one recipe.<br><br>She would have the motivation to do so.| Because there are several options that she is trying to deliberate between, she may not know what she is going to choose first. <br><br>*Refer to above solution
5)	Checks if she has the ingredients in the recipe |She would have the knowledge to do this because it is her kitchen.<br><br> is believable that she would check. <br><br>She would have the motivation to look through her kitchen because she doesn’t want to waste her time creating a dish.|
6) <br><br> A. She likes the recipe and has the ingredients, so she puts it in bookmarks <br><br>B. She likes the recipe and doesn’t have the ingredients, so she stores it in favorites to refer to later | On both A and B, because Khadija only recently downloaded this app, she may not know to do either action. <br><br>In terms of believability, it is believable that she will do B, but not A.<br><br>She would have the motivation to utilize the ‘Add to Favorites’ button, but not the bookmarking system.| The difference between the bookmarks and favorites is that one is that the former is intended for short-term use while the latter is meant to last on the long-term. Another difference is that bookmarks is primarily to keep track of which particular step they are in within a recipe, alongside being able to flip through various recipes. <br><br>However, Khadija may not know the difference because this is her first time using the interface and end up using them interchangeably.<br><br>Another issue is that, because the bookmarks are on the side and ‘Add to Favorites’ is directly in Khadija’s line of sight, she is less motivated to utilize the bookmarks in terms of tracking a particular recipe. <br><br>Solution a: Make the difference more obvious via a prompt. Eg. For the bookmarking: “If you want to save this step, then click this”<br><br>Solution b: Do not allow bookmarking at the beginning of the recipe. Only allow the use of bookmarks in between steps of the recipe so that the user knows what their purpose is, preventing the confusion between ‘favorite’ and ‘bookmark’<br><br>Solution c: Rename ‘bookmark’ to ‘recipe tab’ or ‘recipe bank’, etc, any name that is more straightforward on the role of the bookmarking system so that the user gets a sense of how to use it <br><br>Solution d: Give the bookmarking system as much attention as the ‘Add to Favorites’ button by placing it in the center of the screen
7)<br><br>A. She wants more recipes, so she presses the return button to go to back to the results page<br><br>B. She’s done, so she closes the app | For B, all three are applicable. <br><br>For A, however, she would not know to use the ‘back arrow’ button on the very left; nor is it believable that she would use it to return to the results page. In fact, she may just use the home button and repeat the previous steps. She would not have the motivation to do so either.| Due to its vague shape and placement, Khadija may be confused by the arrow. If she has decided to look through the steps in the recipe at any point before this, then she may be led to believe that the ‘back arrow’ image indicates going back a page, rather than returning to the results page.<br><br>Solution: Change the arrow button to a text button stating where exactly the user will go if they press it, Ex. “Search Results”, “Home”, etc
8)	If she wants more recipes, repeat 4-7 | She would have the knowledge to do so if she figured out the last steps. However, she may not know how to bookmark multiple recipes.<br><br>It is also believable that she would repeat these steps because she wants more recipes so her children aren’t bored. <br><br>She may not have the motivation to do so because she has to go back and forth between the list and the recipes. | There can be multiple bookmarks in one session. However, she may not understand this and think that only one bookmark at a time is allotted. <br><br>Solution: Have default names for the bookmarks, eg. “Bookmark 1”, which would indicate that there can be more than one bookmark <br><br>Another issue is that most people, when they want to look at several things at once, open up all of the possibilities that they like and then go through the ones that they’ve chosen after they’re done scanning the list <br><br>Solution: Have it so we can have a multi-tab system without opening the actual recipe right away
9) Closes app | No issues | 

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/AD-impaired.jpg "Affinity group 1: Assist group")
**Assist Group**. This grouping has a collection of sketches with the functionality of assisting those with impairments. The value of this category is that we confirmed the extent of our knowledge of the possible issues that our users may have while utilizing a recipe-handling system. Unfortunately, the weakness of this category is that the users represented by this group are not the ones that we are targeting. The originality was rampant in this category, and startlingly, as was feasibility. None of the ideas were too crazy, though they would require some special equipment to actually make them come to life.

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/AD-movement.jpg "Affinity group 2: Movement group")
**Movement Group.** This grouping is primarily sketches that focuses on different ways the user can move between steps of a recipe. In terms of our design requirements, we needed a simple way for the user to be able to go between steps without too much trouble. We thought of multiple designs for it, ranging from timed systems to a simple button. This grouping is invaluable in the fact that it allowed us to choose between various methods of moving between pages, but it is limited by the singular functionality of movement. Most of the ideas in the group are fairly feasible since they are rather simplistic in design; originality is surprisingly high between the various methods of traversing through the recipe.

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/AD-preferences.jpg "Affinity group 3: Preferences group")
**Preferences Group.** This grouping focused on different methods of adjusting a user’s preferences for recipes. Within our design requirements, we needed the ability to adjust meals based serving size, and also a way to manage preferences of the user. The value of this group is that we were able to pick up each of the functionalities and add relevant parts of the sketch to our main ideas. The weakness of the group is that the actual items designated in the category are ones we have biases toward, making it difficult to claim them as disposable. The ideas are relatively original, though they pull strongly from pre-existing methods of filtering the user’s search results; as while the sketches are feasible for the most part.

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/AD-UI.jpg "Affinity group 4: UI group")
**UI Group.** This grouping consists of multiple ways we could showcase the UI of the system. In relation to our design requirements, we needed a basic, but familiar system that would not alienate the user (who we intend to be parents who likely have little experience in terms of software). The strength of this group lays in the various designs that we were able to conjure for various parts of the system, but the weaknesses were that the sketches – despite different functionality – are relatively similar in idea. Originality suffered due to our original desire to have a book-like UI. Feasibility is high in this group. 

![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/AD-wierd.jpg "Affinity group 5: Unusual group")
**Unusual Group.** This grouping had sketches that were not possible to use with our current technology or unrelated to the goal of the system. This category did not relate much to our actual design requirements. This group’s strength was strongly tied to its high originality: due to its outlandish nature, we were able to think of subsystems that may arise, eg. A system where the recipe is projected onto a different surface in order to prevent getting food items all over their phone/computer. The weakness of this group is linked to the feasibility, in that there is no way we would be able create them with our current resources. Furthermore, the ideas themselves are somewhat unrelated to the goal of the system (VR, for example).

# Book Idea
![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/promising1.jpg "Polished promising idea #1")

This was our main idea that we decided on in our brainstorming phase. It is a book design with various features that implemented the functionalities that we also deliberated on during the brainstorming phase. Initially, it was simply a book design with the choice of alternative recipes. In its intermediate stage, we combined the idea of swiping left and right from the movement group and vocalized instructions from the assist group with the book design. The final state included a bookmarking system and a gifs or pictures to showcase the individual step of the recipe, alongside needed ingredients for each step.

# Voice Command Idea
![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/promising2.jpg "Polished promising idea #2")

Alongside the idea of giving the interface voice commands, we also decided on having a specific name in order to have a sense of personalization.

# Profile Idea
![](https://geraldranches.github.io/481-T01group4-project/promising3.jpg "Polished promising idea #3")

This is a functionality intended to host the preferences of separate people, or separate occasions. It is able to provide a different default serving size rather than the user always changing the serving size manually for each meal. It also keeps track of certain food allergies, dietary restrictions, and the name for each separate profile. For example, a mother can keep track of the serving size and dietary restrictions of her son’s birthday parties, while also keeping track of the servings for a fancy dinner that she can show off to her friends.


## Reflection

When we were entering the process of ideation, we already had a joint idea of our interface’s appearance and functionality based on the activities that we had to complete during the tutorial sessions. However, we felt that they were insufficient because of the short timeframe we were allotted in those times, and thus decided to recreate them outside of tutorial. Among the processes that we used, the creation of the storyboard, video prototype, and task-centered walkthrough were the most successful in helping us deviate from our stubborn mindset. For example, in our initial UI, we were adamant on utilizing a “Resume Session” function (which was intended to help the user continue their last set of ‘bookmarks’) within our menu. However, we realized through the storyboard that the idea of the “Resume Session” was redundant when paired with our bookmarking system. The video prototype, on the other hand, gave us hands-on experience on how exactly a user would be accessing the buttons and filters for searching the recipes, which aided us in potential placements of buttons and text. The task-centered walkthrough, meanwhile, opened up various problems that a potential user would have: such as the fact that having both the bookmarking system and a separate recipe saving functionality (ie. Adding the recipe to your favourites) would confuse the user due to their similar usages.

The least successful activities were the brainstorming and affinity diagramming respectively. We had already brainstormed and decided our main design idea during tutorial, which decreased our motivation to redo the activity in our own time. Fortunately, the activity did give rise to a few new functionalities despite the fact that we had already done it during tutorial. Unfortunately, because of this bias during our brainstorming sessions, along with our desire to maintain our previously decided idea, the affinity diagramming activity was largely useless in our ideation process. We had already discussed what we desired amongst ourselves outside of the activity. On the whole, we admittedly focused too much on the details and, because of this, were slowed during the ideation process. Conclusively, if we had to do this process again, we would ensure that we would immediately do an affinity diagramming session shortly after our brainstorming session (which we largely neglected), and that we would focus less on the details of our design when we’re in the period of ‘getting the right design.’

# Summary Changes (Group purposes)
Storyboard yielded:
Remove the ‘resume session’ button from the main screen and instead maintain a universal bookmarking system that is accessible anywhere in the app.
Video Prototype yielded:
All of the filters – food preferences alongside dietary restrictions – in one separate screen better than having it all within the main menu screen. Also gave us an idea of how much ‘screens’ we could reuse in order to maintain a certain level of efficiency.
Brainstorming yielded:
We decided on an amimated splash screen of a pancake being flipped.
