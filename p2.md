## Task-Centered System Walkthrough
## Task Description: 
Khadija Abdulla is a 31-year-old woman who has four kids of ages 4, 6, 10, and 13. Because her husband left her when the fourth child was born, she is very occupied with both a day job and a night job, one being part time.

She normally writes her recipes in a journal, but frequently finds that her youngest child draws on it. Also, her children use her phone to play games and there are times that she won’t know where her phone is. The oldest child has a habit of raiding the pantry for ingredients, and it is not unusual for Khadija to end up missing ingredients when she’s cooking.

Due to her labor-intensive work, the meals she makes are repetitive and her children are beginning to complain. Khadija’s desire is to learn a new recipe that can be made in large batches (in a short amount of time) that will appeal to her children and end the complaints. Furthermore, they are of the Muslim religion, so they require the recipes be in halal.

She has recently downloaded this app due to the prompting of her work friends, but has trouble using software.

Sub-Task | Knowledgeable? Believable? Has motivation? | Comment/Solution |
--- | --- | --- |
1) Opens app |Khadija knows how to use a phone, it is believable that she would open it, and she would have the motivation to open the app in order to access it. | Should probably figure out a noticeable icon
2)	Selects the ‘Halal’ filtering on the front | Knowledge-wise, she is aware of the phrase and would choose it.<br><br>It would be believable that she would choose it do so, given the fact that, due to Khadija’s background, she would check whether or not her food is halal before eating it. <br><br>She would have the motivation to do so because she wants her food to be halal.|The wording and placement of the ‘halal’ filter will disappear if she decides to choose anything onward (ie. A category or recipe), which may cause some confusion for Khadija because she may think that the filter has disappeared.<br><br> Should research what ‘halal’ means. Should we instead let them filter ‘pork’ out? Or would it be more accommodating to write down ‘halal’?<br><br>Solution a?: Allow them more freedom with filtering.<br><br>Solution b: Allow them filter on the actual search bar instead?<br><br>Solution c: Change how it looks like by designating a special area in the main menu specifically for filters.
3)	Searches up a meal using the search bar | Because she likely has experience with search bars on the internet, she would have the knowledge to use it.<br><br>It may not be believable because she may, instead, choose a category to filter her options.<br><br>She would not have the motivation to use the search bar because she wouldn’t know what to search up in the first place. | When people are looking for new recipes, they normally search general terminology, ie. “Good and easy recipes” and look through the list to see which looks best. They don’t look up a particular recipe if they don’t know what they’re looking for.<br><br>Solution: Add “popular” or “recommended” meals so she doesn’t have to manually search things. Sort the meals by popularity as well.
4)	Chooses a meal from the results in the search bar | She knows how to select items from a list.<br><br>It is believable that she would choose at least one recipe.<br><br>She would have the motivation to do so.| Because there are several options that she is trying to deliberate between, she may not know what she is going to choose first. <br><br>*Refer to above solution
5)	Checks if she has the ingredients in the recipe |She would have the knowledge to do this because it is her kitchen.<br><br> is believable that she would check. <br><br>She would have the motivation to look through her kitchen because she doesn’t want to waste her time creating a dish.|
6) <br><br> A. She likes the recipe and has the ingredients, so she puts it in bookmarks <br><br>B. She likes the recipe and doesn’t have the ingredients, so she stores it in favorites to refer to later | On both A and B, because Khadija only recently downloaded this app, she may not know to do either action. <br><br>In terms of believability, it is believable that she will do B, but not A.<br><br>She would have the motivation to utilize the ‘Add to Favorites’ button, but not the bookmarking system.| The difference between the bookmarks and favorites is that one is that the former is intended for short-term use while the latter is meant to last on the long-term. Another difference is that bookmarks is primarily to keep track of which particular step they are in within a recipe, alongside being able to flip through various recipes. <br><br>However, Khadija may not know the difference because this is her first time using the interface and end up using them interchangeably.<br><br>Another issue is that, because the bookmarks are on the side and ‘Add to Favorites’ is directly in Khadija’s line of sight, she is less motivated to utilize the bookmarks in terms of tracking a particular recipe. <br><br>Solution a: Make the difference more obvious via a prompt. Eg. For the bookmarking: “If you want to save this step, then click this”<br><br>Solution b: Do not allow bookmarking at the beginning of the recipe. Only allow the use of bookmarks in between steps of the recipe so that the user knows what their purpose is, preventing the confusion between ‘favorite’ and ‘bookmark’<br><br>Solution c: Rename ‘bookmark’ to ‘recipe tab’ or ‘recipe bank’, etc, any name that is more straightforward on the role of the bookmarking system so that the user gets a sense of how to use it <br><br>Solution d: Give the bookmarking system as much attention as the ‘Add to Favorites’ button by placing it in the center of the screen
7)<br><br>A. She wants more recipes, so she presses the return button to go to back to the results page<br><br>B. She’s done, so she closes the app | For B, all three are applicable. <br><br>For A, however, she would not know to use the ‘back arrow’ button on the very left; nor is it believable that she would use it to return to the results page. In fact, she may just use the home button and repeat the previous steps. She would not have the motivation to do so either.| Due to its vague shape and placement, Khadija may be confused by the arrow. If she has decided to look through the steps in the recipe at any point before this, then she may be led to believe that the ‘back arrow’ image indicates going back a page, rather than returning to the results page.<br><br>Solution: Change the arrow button to a text button stating where exactly the user will go if they press it, Ex. “Search Results”, “Home”, etc
8)	If she wants more recipes, repeat 4-7 | She would have the knowledge to do so if she figured out the last steps. However, she may not know how to bookmark multiple recipes.<br><br>It is also believable that she would repeat these steps because she wants more recipes so her children aren’t bored. <br><br>She may not have the motivation to do so because she has to go back and forth between the list and the recipes. | There can be multiple bookmarks in one session. However, she may not understand this and think that only one bookmark at a time is allotted. <br><br>Solution: Have default names for the bookmarks, eg. “Bookmark 1”, which would indicate that there can be more than one bookmark <br><br>Another issue is that most people, when they want to look at several things at once, open up all of the possibilities that they like and then go through the ones that they’ve chosen after they’re done scanning the list <br><br>Solution: Have it so we can have a multi-tab system without opening the actual recipe right away
9) Closes app | No issues |
